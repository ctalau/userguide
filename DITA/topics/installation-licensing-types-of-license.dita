  <title>Choosing a License Type kjsdk jf </title>
  <body>
    <p>You can use one of the following license types with <ph keyref="product"/>:<ol
        id="ol_xr3_j1z_x4">
      <li>A named-user license may be used by a single <term keyref="glossentry_named-user"/> on one or more computers.
        Named-user licenses are not transferable to a new <term keyref="glossentry_named-user"/>. If you order multiple
          named-user licenses, you will receive a single license key good for a specified number of
          named users. It is your responsibility to keep track of the named users that each license
          is assigned to.</li>
        <li product="author developer editor authorEclipse developerEclipse editorEclipse">A
          floating license may be used by any user on any machine. However, the total number of
          copies of <ph keyref="product"/> in use at one time must not be more than the number of
          floating licenses available. A user who runs two different distributions of <ph
            keyref="product"/> (for example, Standalone and Eclipse Plugin) at the same time on the
          same computer, consumes a single floating license.</li>
        <li product="editor editorEclipse">A special academic license (classroom, department or site
          license) may be used by students and teachers in academic institutions. These licenses
          provide a cost effective way of getting access to <ph keyref="product"/> for learning
          purposes.</li>
        <li product="svnClient">A site license may be used by all the people that belong to the
          organization that purchased the site license.</li>
      </ol></p>
    <p>For definitions and legal details of the license types, consult the End User License
      Agreement available at <ph conkeyref="reusable_links/eula"/>.</p>
